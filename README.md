This repository contains a tutorial on using Python for machine learning. The tutorial is designed for beginners who are new to Python or to machine learning.
# Getting Started

To get started with the tutorial, you will need to install Python and some Python libraries. We recommend using the Anaconda distribution, which includes many popular Python libraries for machine learning.

You can download Anaconda from the official website: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual

Once you have installed Anaconda, you can create a new environment:

bash

conda env create -f environment.yml

.
# Tutorial Outline

The tutorial is divided into several sections, each covering a different aspect of machine learning in Python. The sections are:

    1. Introduction to Python
    2. Scientific modules
    3. Data analysis and visualization
    4. Machine learning applications
    5. Data scientist approach

Each section includes code examples and exercises that you can try out on your own.
